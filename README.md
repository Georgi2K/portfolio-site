# Computer Vision

**Description**: Short and Accurate CV Image Classifier + Program to use the trained model with the given Dataset (in this case, with dogs and cats)

**Technologies**: Python, Matplotlib, tensorflow, cv2

**Functionalities**:
Learns images into pixels, which are processed by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract the differential features of given dogs and cats in the Dataset.
Determines if the given image by the user is either a Dog or a Cat

**Installation and Launch**:
Download the Database (feel free to either add more photos for accuracy or even change the images for example with bikes and cars)
Input the Dataset Path in the training model (First model)
Only use the second model *AFTER* training the image classifier with the first
Download your own image (off of Google for example) & switch it with the one i've put in (pexels-chevanon-1108099.jpg)
Check if the prediction was right!
